// 3.
//null means “intentional absence of any object value.” It’s like saying: “This variable has no value, and that’s on purpose.”
//
//undefined means “a variable has been declared but not assigned any value yet.” It’s the default state of a variable that exists but hasn’t been given a value.
//
//  undefined = default as nothing has been assigned yet. null = nothing but its meant to be that way.
//
// 4.
// Numbers cannot be at the start of a variable name
//
// 5.
//  NaN is Not a number but in JS IT IS A NUMBER TECHNICALLY
// NaN is actually a special numeric value that means “invalid number” or “not a valid number.”
//  null is an OBJECT
//
// Focus Areas Before Day 2:
// Hoisting vs initialization — especially differences with var and let.
// Understanding scope — block vs function.
// JavaScript quirks like typeof null and typeof NaN.
// Avoiding accidental globals and the benefits of strict mode.
//
